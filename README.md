The thyroid gland is an endocrine gland. The thyroid organ discharges thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) into the bloodstream as the principal hormones. The capacities of the thyroid hormones are to direct the rate of digestion system and affect the overall development of the human body. There are two most common problems of thyroid disorder, they are Hyperthyroidism â€“ discharges too much thyroid hormone into the blood due to overactivity of thyroid and Hypothyroidism - when the thyroid is not active and discharges less thyroid hormone into the blood. More than 12 percent of the U.S. population develop a thyroid condition during their lifetime. An estimated 20 million Americans have some form of thyroid disease. Up to 60 percent of those with thyroid disease are unaware of their condition. Comparative study of various classification algorithms for predictive modeling to identify whether a patient is sick and is affected by the thyroid is the primary objective of this report.
